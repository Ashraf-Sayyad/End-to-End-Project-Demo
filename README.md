Comprehensive Analysis of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Image Classification: A Study of PCA, Random Projection and Autoencoder

In an age characterized by Big Data, the issues presented by the ‘Curse of Dimensionality’
have become increasingly important in the field of data science and machine learning. This
research addresses these challenges by investigating techniques for reducing dimensionality,
specifically focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Random Projection (RP),
t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation
and Projection) and Autoencoder within the context of machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL). This research aims to evaluate the efficiency of PCA and RP in reducing
dimension of high-dimensional datasets, particularly focusing on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss
Lemma approach for random projection. Additionally, it explores how t-SNE, UMAP, and
autoencoder can be utilized for deeper understanding as compared to the PCA and RP.
Furthermore, this research explores the efficacy of these techniques in terms of preserving
the information and structure of the given initial data, as well as their impact on the performance
of machine learning models. Autoencoders are a form of dimensionality reduction
and are employed for feature learning in deep learning.

In this comprehensive and comparative research, we have implemented different dimension
reduction techniques such as PCA, RP, t-SNE, UMAP to various datasets and analyzing
their impact on a range of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support
Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbour.
A comparison is conducted to evaluate the impact of reducing dimensionality on algorithm
performance using an advanced CNN model with an autoencoder. The analysis emphasizes
metrics such as computational efficiency and accuracy measures, including precision, F1
score, and recall.

This work expects to yield valuable perspectives on the efficiency and efficacy of different
dimension reduction techniques in the context of ML and DL. The application of dimension
reduction methods has grown in significance as a result of the difficulties presented by
datasets with high dimensions.The findings of this research are anticipated to clarify the
trade-offs between maintaining high precision and ensuring computational efficiency, which
is a crucial factor in real-world applications of ML and DL.
